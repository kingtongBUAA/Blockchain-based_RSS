Hello, welcome to this repository!  
The Codebase for paper "A Blockchain-based Resource Supervision Scheme for Edge Devices under Cloud-Fog-End Computing Models."  
This repository contains the code developed and used by the paper "A Blockchain-based Resource Supervision Scheme for Edge Device under Cloud-Fog-End Computing Models", and will be used as the codebase of this paper to support the subsequent research.   
The codebase mainly includes two aspects: 1. Smart contract mentioned in the paper. 2. Demo script of Tensorflow_Federated that used for the experiment.
